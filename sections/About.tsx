                                Elena Morrison is a debut novelist whose lifelong passion for storytelling finally found its voice in <em>Whispers of the Heart</em>. Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, she draws inspiration from the misty landscapes and rich histories that surround her.
                            </p>
                            <p>After spending fifteen years as a literature professor, Elena decided to pursue her dream of writing fiction full-time. Her work explores themes of memory, identity, and the invisible threads that connect us across time and distance.</p>
                            <p>When she's not writing, Elena can be found hiking in the mountains, curating her ever-growing collection of vintage books, or enjoying a quiet afternoon with a cup of tea and her two rescue dogs.</p>
